# Molecular-Fingerprinting
This project uses RDKit and PubChemPy to generate molecular fingerprints of statins, compute Tanimoto similarity matrices, perform hierarchical clustering, and visualize structural relationships. It demonstrates computational analysis of drug similarity with interpretable and reproducible workflows
